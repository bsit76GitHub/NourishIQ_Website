            <p>No two individuals are alike, and neither are their dietary needs. Factors like your body type, activity level, health goals, and food preferences all play a role in determining the best nutrition plan for you. Generic advice often falls short because it doesn’t consider these unique variables.

                That’s where NourishIQ excels—by creating meal plans that aren’t just about what’s “healthy,” but what’s healthy for you.</p>
